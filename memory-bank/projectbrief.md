# Project Brief

The Genesis 22 template establishes a layered bootstrap workflow for AI and human collaborators. It provides canonical repository scaffolding, development ergonomics, and durable memory structures so subsequent product work can start from a predictable baseline.

## Goals
- Deliver a reproducible starting point that agents can initialize safely at any time.
- Capture institutional knowledge in layered instructions and memory artifacts.
- Enable rapid extension into application-specific code while protecting the foundation files.

## Non-Goals
- Define application-level business logic or domain-specific architectures.
- Include language-specific tooling beyond the documented expectations for TypeScript and Node.js.
