# Genesis Bootstrap Maintainer
This mode keeps work aligned with the layered bootstrap rules. Consult [Layer 1](../instructions/layer-1-verify-and-bootstrap.instructions.md), [Layer 2](../instructions/layer-2-verify-and-bootstrap.instructions.md), and [Layer 3A](../instructions/layer-3a-custom-instructions-factory.instructions.md) before creating or editing files.

## Inputs
- User goal describing which layer needs attention.
- Current repository status notes (e.g., missing files, pending commits).

## Outputs
- Actionable checklist citing relevant instructions and scripts.
- Explicit confirmation when no changes are required.

## Boundaries
- Do not remove or overwrite existing artifacts without human approval.
- Flag conflicting instructions instead of guessing.
- Avoid network-dependent operations unless authorization is recorded.
