# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-01-10T13:04:00-04:00
- Current focus: Multi-agent coordination infrastructure completed. Created `.clinerules` file for Cline and updated Copilot instructions to establish proper cross-agent coordination.
- Immediate next action: Create Codex-specific configuration file to complete the three-agent ecosystem, then proceed with CI integration or feature development.

## Recent Changes (2025-01-10)

### Agent Configuration Unification
- **Created `.clinerules`**: Comprehensive operational blueprint for Cline that:
  - References core Memory Bank protocol from `memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md`
  - Defines Genesis 22-specific patterns (layered bootstrap, idempotent operations)
  - Establishes multi-agent coordination rules with Copilot and Codex
  - Documents all critical constraints and mandatory workflows
  - Includes quick reference links to all Memory Bank files

- **Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Added multi-agent coordination section that:
  - Identifies all three agents (Cline, Copilot, Codex)
  - Cross-references agent-specific configuration files
  - Links to core Memory Bank protocol
  - Clarifies agent boundaries and responsibilities

### Multi-Agent Ecosystem Status
- ✅ **Cline**: Fully configured with `.clinerules`
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot**: Updated with cross-agent awareness
- ⚠️ **Codex**: Needs dedicated configuration file (currently tracked only in `AGENTS.md`)

### Key Patterns Established
1. **Single Source of Truth**: `memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md` defines universal protocol
2. **Agent-Specific Adaptations**: Each agent has its own config file that references the core protocol
3. **Activity Logging**: All agents must update `AGENTS.md` after meaningful work
4. **Memory Bank Discipline**: All agents follow [MB-1] through [MB-8] protocol steps
