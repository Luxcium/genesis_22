# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-10-15T14:30:00+00:00
- Current focus: Extending automation coverage to guard Memory Bank artefacts, particularly the canonical ExecPlan template.
- Immediate next action: Monitor ensure-plans.sh adoption, reconcile any detected drift, and keep Memory Bank automation scripts aligned with template updates.

## Recent Changes (2025-10-15)

### Memory Bank Agents Safeguard
- **Created `scripts/ensure-plans.sh`**: Adds an idempotent guard that ensures `memory-bank/agents/PLANS.md` exists and matches the upstream Genesis 22 reference.
  - Generates directory structure when missing and installs the canonical template automatically.
  - Compares local versus remote copies via background diffing, signalling drift through exit codes.
  - Supports `--show-diff` flag for detailed inspection without altering local changes.
- **Updated `scripts/README.md`**: Documented the new script in both the quick reference table and detailed sections, outlining usage, exit codes, and guidance for AI agents and humans.
- Automation Impact: Provides a lightweight compliance check so agents can quickly detect divergence from the authoritative ExecPlan instructions.

### Script Infrastructure Enhancement
- **Created `scripts/env-setup.sh`**: Comprehensive 530-line environment validation script that:
  - Validates Bash, Git, Python, and Node.js installations and versions
  - Checks project structure (foundation files, memory-bank directories)
  - Validates Jupyter notebook environment setup
  - Verifies all shell scripts are executable
  - Generates detailed environment report with system information
  - Supports `--verbose` and `--report-only` flags
  - Provides both AI agent and human user guidance
  - Fully idempotent and safe to run repeatedly
  - Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (warnings), 2 (critical failure)

- **Enhanced All Existing Scripts**: Added comprehensive documentation to:
  - `init.sh` - Foundation verification and git initialization (100+ line header)
  - `triad-health.sh` - Memory-bank health validation (60+ line header)
  - `validate-memory-bank.sh` - Instruction file validator (50+ line header)
  - `validate-chatmodes.sh` - Chatmode file validator (140+ line header)
  - `validate-prompts.sh` - Prompt file validator (130+ line header)
  - `list-slash-commands.sh` - Slash command discovery (40+ line header)

- **Documentation Overhaul**:
  - `scripts/README.md`: Expanded from 13 lines to 350+ lines with:
    - Quick reference table for all scripts
    - Detailed documentation for each script (purpose, usage, exit codes)
    - AI agent and human user guidelines
    - Script requirements and conventions
    - Adding new scripts workflow
    - Maintenance guidelines
    - Troubleshooting section
    - Related documentation links
  
  - `README.md`: Enhanced from 33 lines to 350+ lines with:
    - Comprehensive AI agent maintenance instructions
    - Memory Bank protocol guidance
    - Code documentation standards (TypeScript, Python, Shell)
    - File creation and modification rules
    - Validation and testing requirements
    - Session workflow for AI agents
    - Common patterns and preferences
    - Project structure diagram
    - Environment setup instructions
    - Contributing guidelines for both humans and AI agents

### Script Documentation Standards Established
All scripts now include:
1. **Header block** with:
   - Purpose statement
   - Usage examples with flags/options
   - Exit code documentation
   - Step-by-step explanation of what the script does
   - AI agent specific instructions
   - Human user specific instructions
2. **Section headers** using comment blocks
3. **Inline comments** explaining complex logic
4. **Logging functions** with consistent format (`[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]`, `[OK]`, `[FAIL]`)

### AI Agent Maintenance Guidelines Documented
- Memory Bank protocol (read first, document decisions, write before end)
- Core memory bank files always requiring updates
- Code documentation standards for all languages
- File creation and modification rules
- Validation requirements before committing
- Session workflow (start, during, end)
- Testing standards and best practices

### Testing and Validation Completed
- ✅ All scripts tested and verified working
- ✅ `env-setup.sh` generates comprehensive environment report
- ✅ All validators pass on current repository state
- ✅ Scripts confirmed idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- ✅ Exit codes verified for all scripts
- ✅ Documentation accuracy validated

### Key Patterns and Decisions
1. **Idempotence First**: All scripts check state before making changes
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every script has both AI and human guidance
3. **Structured Logging**: Consistent message format across all scripts
4. **Exit Code Standards**: 0 = success, 1 = warnings/failures, 2 = critical
5. **Validation Before Commit**: Clear guidelines on when to run which validators
6. **Session State Preservation**: Explicit instructions for AI agents to update memory bank

## Recent Changes (2025-01-10)

### Agent Configuration Unification
- **Created `.clinerules`**: Comprehensive operational blueprint for Cline that:
  - References core Memory Bank protocol from `memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md`
  - Defines Genesis 22-specific patterns (layered bootstrap, idempotent operations)
  - Establishes multi-agent coordination rules with Copilot and Codex
  - Documents all critical constraints and mandatory workflows
  - Includes quick reference links to all Memory Bank files

- **Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Added multi-agent coordination section that:
  - Identifies all three agents (Cline, Copilot, Codex)
  - Cross-references agent-specific configuration files
  - Links to core Memory Bank protocol
  - Clarifies agent boundaries and responsibilities

### Multi-Agent Ecosystem Status
- ✅ **Cline**: Fully configured with `.clinerules`
- ✅ **GitHub Copilot**: Updated with cross-agent awareness
- ⚠️ **Codex**: Needs dedicated configuration file (currently tracked only in `AGENTS.md`)

### Key Patterns Established
1. **Single Source of Truth**: `memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md` defines universal protocol
2. **Agent-Specific Adaptations**: Each agent has its own config file that references the core protocol
3. **Activity Logging**: All agents must update `AGENTS.md` after meaningful work
4. **Memory Bank Discipline**: All agents follow [MB-1] through [MB-8] protocol steps

  - `.python-version`: Python 3.12 specification
  - `.gitignore`: Notebook-specific ignore patterns
  - Directory structure: `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, `models/`, `outputs/` with `.gitkeep` files
