# Progress Log

## 2025-10-19
- **Markdown Linting Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive markdown validation system for project-wide consistency.
- **New Script: validate-markdown.sh**: Full-featured markdown validator (400+ lines) that checks:
  - Trailing spaces, multiple blank lines, hard tabs
  - Heading formatting (spacing, punctuation)
  - Code block language specification
  - Common typos (15+ patterns with auto-fix capability)
  - Line length recommendations
- **New Documentation: markdown-linting-rules.instructions.md**: Complete linting rules reference (270+ lines) covering:
  - All markdown formatting rules with examples
  - Project-specific conventions
  - AI agent compliance guidelines
  - Common typo reference list
- **Fixed 9 Markdown Errors**: Resolved all critical linting issues across 6 files:
  - Removed trailing spaces from 5 instruction files
  - Fixed heading punctuation in PLANS.md
  - Removed multiple consecutive blank lines
  - Improved script to skip code blocks when validating headings
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced `scripts/README.md` with complete validate-markdown.sh documentation
- **Script Improvements**: Fixed bugs in validate-markdown.sh (set -e issue, regex patterns, code block handling)
- **Validation Updates**: Added markdown-linting-rules.instructions.md to external links allow-list
- Impact: All markdown files now pass validation with 0 errors. AI agents have clear linting guidelines and automated validation tools.
- Status: ✅ Complete - Markdown linting infrastructure fully implemented, tested, and documented.

## 2025-10-15
- **Memory Bank Agents Guardrail**: Added `scripts/ensure-plans.sh` to guarantee `memory-bank/agents/PLANS.md` exists and matches the upstream Genesis 22 template, with optional diff output for drift analysis.
- **Documentation Update**: Expanded `scripts/README.md` to cover the new guard script in the quick reference table and detailed guidance sections.
- Impact: Agents now have an automated check to detect and reconcile ExecPlan template divergence without manual inspection.

## 2025-10-12
- **Script Infrastructure Overhaul**: Complete enhancement of all shell scripts with comprehensive documentation.
- **Environment Validation**: Created `scripts/env-setup.sh` (530 lines) for comprehensive environment validation and reporting.
- **Documentation Revolution**: Enhanced both `scripts/README.md` (350+ lines) and main `README.md` (350+ lines) with extensive AI agent and human user guidance.
- **Script Documentation Standards**: All 7 scripts now include detailed header blocks with purpose, usage, exit codes, AI agent instructions, and human user instructions.
- **Idempotence Verified**: All scripts tested and confirmed safe to run multiple times without side effects.
- **AI Agent Guidelines**: Documented comprehensive file maintenance instructions, memory bank protocol, code documentation standards, validation requirements, and session workflows.
- **Testing Complete**: All scripts validated working correctly, generating expected output and exit codes.
- Status: ✅ Complete - All deliverables implemented, tested, and documented.
- Next: Consider CI/CD integration for automated validation, or proceed with additional tooling enhancements.

## 2025-10-11
- **Jupyter Notebook Template Infrastructure**: Created comprehensive canonical notebook template system in `notebooks/` directory.
- **Flagship Example**: Developed `canonical-template.ipynb` with 7-section structure demonstrating professional notebook practices.
- **Complete Documentation**: Created extensive `notebooks/README.md` (400+ lines) covering quick start, environment setup, best practices, troubleshooting, and references.
- **Python Environment**: Established Python 3.12 baseline with `requirements.txt` (production deps) and `requirements-dev.txt` (development deps).
- **Directory Structure**: Set up `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, `models/`, `outputs/` with appropriate `.gitkeep` files and `.gitignore`.
- **Best Practices Demonstrated**: Type hints, comprehensive docstrings, reproducibility patterns, memory management, error handling, and both static/interactive visualizations.
- **Dependencies**: Full data science stack (numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn), visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly), development tools (black, isort, pylint, mypy, ruff), testing (pytest, nbval), and documentation (sphinx, nbsphinx).
- Next: CI/CD integration for notebook validation, or continue with Codex configuration for three-agent ecosystem completion.

## 2025-01-10
- **Multi-Agent Configuration Unification**: Created `.clinerules` file to establish Cline's operational blueprint within the Memory Bank protocol.
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reference `.clinerules` and establish three-agent ecosystem awareness (Cline, Copilot, Codex).
- **Memory Bank Protocol Compliance**: All agent configurations now reference `memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md` as the single source of truth.
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect current multi-agent infrastructure state.
- **Outstanding**: Create Codex-specific configuration file to complete the three-agent ecosystem.
- Next: Complete Codex configuration, then consider CI integration for validators or feature development.

## 2025-09-27
- Layer 1 foundation files created (`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `VERSION`, `scripts/` assets) and `scripts/init.sh` verified for idempotence.
- Layer 2 workspace ergonomics established: VS Code settings, Copilot guardrails, memory-bank triad directories, and six context files initialized.
- Layer 3 bootstrap: Confirmed instruction set, added `.prettierignore`, authored `bootstrap-maintainer.chatmode.md`, and created the `bootstrap-audit.prompt.md` card referencing governing instructions.
- Layer 4 automation: Added validator and health scripts, wired VS Code tasks/settings, ingested commit-policy instructions, refreshed prompt cards, and published `memory-bank/index.md`.
