# Agent Activity Log

This log captures each AI agent session across the Genesis layered bootstrap. Update the table whenever you complete a meaningful stage so the next agent has actionable context.

| Timestamp | Agent | Layer Focus | Key Actions | Handoff / Next Step |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 2025-10-12T02:30:00+00:00 | GitHub Copilot | Script Infrastructure & Documentation | **Comprehensive Enhancement**: Created `scripts/env-setup.sh` (530 lines) for environment validation. Enhanced all 7 scripts with detailed header documentation (AI + human instructions). Expanded `scripts/README.md` from 13→350+ lines with complete script catalog. Expanded main `README.md` from 33→350+ lines with AI agent maintenance guidelines, Memory Bank protocol, code documentation standards, and session workflows. Updated memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `techContext.md`). All scripts tested and verified idempotent. **Total**: ~2000 lines of documentation/code added. | All deliverables complete. Optional: Fix persistent.chatmode.md validator issues, add CI/CD integration, or proceed with feature development. |
| 2025-01-10T13:04:00-04:00 | Cline (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) | Multi-Agent Config | Created `.clinerules` file with comprehensive Cline operational blueprint. Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to establish three-agent coordination (Cline, Copilot, Codex). Updated Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`). All agents now reference single source of truth: `memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md`. | Create Codex-specific configuration file (`.codexrules` or similar) to complete three-agent ecosystem, then proceed with CI integration or feature development. |
| 2025-09-27T08:59:45-04:00 | Codex (GPT-5) | L4 — Automation & health | Authored validator suite, triad health script, VS Code tasks/settings, ingested commit-policy instructions, refreshed prompt cards, and generated `memory-bank/index.md`. | Consider CI wiring for validators or move into feature-level scaffolding. |
| 2025-09-27T08:58:47-04:00 | Codex (GPT-5) | L3 — Guidance scaffolding | Verified instruction corpus, introduced `.prettierignore`, authored `bootstrap-maintainer.chatmode.md`, and created the `bootstrap-audit.prompt.md` card with links to governing layers. | Transition to Layer 4 to plan automation and repository health routines. |
| 2025-09-27T08:57:01-04:00 | Codex (GPT-5) | L2 — Workspace bootstrap | Added VS Code workspace settings, authored Copilot guardrails, created memory-bank triad directories with READMEs, and initialized six core context files with current information. | Advance to Layer 3 to author reusable instructions, prompts, and chat modes as needed. |
| 2025-09-27T08:54:56-04:00 | Codex (GPT-5) | L1 — Foundation complete | Authored baseline repository files, created `scripts/init.sh`, verified executability, and double-checked idempotence by rerunning the initializer. | Proceed to Layer 2: add workspace ergonomics and memory-bank triad artifacts. |
| 2025-09-27T08:54:34-04:00 | Codex (GPT-5) | L1 — Foundation prep | Ran `init-genesis-22.sh` to download layered instructions; audited repository and noted missing foundation artifacts. | Finish Layer 1 by creating baseline files and verifying `scripts/init.sh` idempotence. |

## Usage Guidance
- Log entries in reverse chronological order (newest at top).
- Capture what changed, why it matters, and what remains.
- Reference related `memory-bank/*` updates or commits where helpful.
