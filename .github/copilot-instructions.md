# Copilot Guardrails

- Prioritize TypeScript solutions and ensure exported APIs include TSDoc blocks describing purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Assume Node.js 22 or later for runtime behaviors, syntax, and library availability; avoid features outside that baseline.
- Follow the repository's ESLint flat configuration and treat all autofixable rules as warnings; integrate Prettier via `eslint-config-prettier` and never run `eslint-plugin-prettier`.
- Consider files in `memory-bank/` as the authoritative context. Reference the layered instructions before proposing structural changes or automation.
- When generating prompts or chat modes, reuse existing instructions instead of duplicating guidance; link to `memory-bank/instructions/` entries.
- Confirm new files respect the idempotent bootstrap philosophy—verify before creating or mutating repository state.

## Usage Guidance

- Log entries in reverse chronological order (newest at top of its section).
- Capture what changed, why it matters, and what remains.
- Reference related `memory-bank/*` updates or commits where helpful.
- The `web/` directory is the Next.js app workspace, avoid confusion.
- Ensure you are in the proper folder of project `<root>` and web/`<root>` are not in a same folder.

## Collaboration Expectations

- Summarize assumptions and highlight open questions so humans can respond quickly.
- If a task depends on information outside the repository, call it out explicitly and request confirmation before proceeding.

## 🤖 Known Limitations

- In any `.prompt.md` or `.chatmode.md` file, the `tools:` front-matter key **must** have its value on the same line (e.g. `tools: [ ... ]`).
  Splitting the array onto the next line currently breaks VS Code's parser and Copilot's tool-detection logic.

## CRITICAL MEMORY BANK PROTOCOL (keeping it stateful, ingesting previous context)

**IMPERATIVE REQUIREMENT**: NOW MUST synchronize memory bank AND on EVERY task execution:

1. **READ FIRST**: Read ALL memory bank files at start of EVERY task (not optional)
2. **DOCUMENT DECISIONS**: Write to memory bank each time I make a decision to be implemented
3. **WRITE BEFORE END**: Update memory bank just before completing any task
4. **STATE PRESERVATION**: Ensure my state will not be lost if interrupted

### Multi-Agent Coordination

GitHub Copilot is one of **three AI agents** working on this project:

1. **Cline** - Task execution, file operations, command execution (see [`.clinerules`](../.clinerules))
2. **GitHub Copilot** (me) - Code completion, inline assistance (THIS FILE)
3. **Codex/Codex-CLI** - Autonomous agent workflows (see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md))

**Cross-Agent References**:
- **Cline's Rules**: [`.clinerules`](../.clinerules) - Cline's operational blueprint
- **Copilot's Rules**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (this file) - My operational blueprint
- **Agent Activity Log**: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - Cross-agent session tracking
- **Core Protocol**: [`memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md`](../memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md) - Universal Memory Bank protocol

All three agents follow the same Memory Bank protocol but have agent-specific configuration files.

### Core Files (Required)

Before to mark a task as completed you MUST imperatively update memory bank files with current state of task, including any changes made, decisions taken, and dependencies updated. why and thought process behind to be kept in mind for future reference.

> [!IMPORTANT] > [Imperative Instructions Git Hub Copilot MUST ALWAYS Follow](../memory-bank/instructions/copilot-memory-bank.instructions.md)

- 'memory-bank/projectbrief.md'
- 'memory-bank/productContext.md'
- 'memory-bank/activeContext.md'
- 'memory-bank/systemPatterns.md'
- 'memory-bank/techContext.md'
- 'memory-bank/dependencies.md'
- 'memory-bank/progress.md'

> [!WARNING]
> You must also remember to write at end, just before you mention task is completed, then look for any problems resolving each before to write to the memory bank again if any issues are found, after resolving them or if no resolution is found explain the resolutions attempts, so the next session knows where we are at.
